### Briefly about myself: 

I am a frontend developer with experience in developing my own projects. 

In 2020 I graduated from the _Belarusian National Technical University_ with a degree in _Power Engineering_.  
Today I work as an engineer in the laboratory of robotic systems at the Academy of Sciences of Belarus.

I also have some C++ and SQL programming experience. 
I always strive to find effective ways to solve specific problems. I am easy to learn and work well in a team.

My main goal is to start a career as a frontend developer and grow to a team leader in 4-5 years.
